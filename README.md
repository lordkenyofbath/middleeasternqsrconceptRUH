## 📋 About The Project

This repository contains the source code for the **RŪH Brand Pitch**, a digital presentation built using Python and Streamlit. 

Unlike static PDF decks, this application serves as a live "Vibe Check" for the client. It utilizes a custom-built SVG rendering engine and CSS injection to create a fully immersive, industrial-dark-mode experience that aligns with the brand's "gritty/street" aesthetic.

**Location:** Singapore  
**Concept:** "Yo-Chi" but for the streets. Middle Eastern Soul Food.

## 🚀 Features

* **Custom SVG Engine:** In-app rendering of scalable vector graphics for the Hero Slide (No external image assets required).
* **Dark Mode Override:** Custom CSS injection to force a specific charcoal/ember color palette, overriding Streamlit's defaults.
* **Interactive Navigation:** State-based slide controller.
* **Responsive Design:** Scales automatically from desktop to mobile.
